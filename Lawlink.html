    <h1>Goal Gradient effect</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
       <p>
        The tendency to approach a goal increases with proximity to the goal.
        </p>
        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <p>The goal-gradient hypothesis, originally proposed by thebehaviorist Clark Hull in 1932, states that the tendency toapproach a goal increases with proximity to the goal. In aclassic experiment that tests this hypothesis, Hull (1934)found that rats in a straight alley ran progressively faster asthey proceeded from the starting box to the food. Althoughthe goal-gradient hypothesis has been investigated exten-sively with animals (e.g., Anderson 1933; Brown 1948; fora review, see Heilizer 1977), its implications for humanbehavior and decision making are understudied. Further-more, this issue has important theoretical and practicalimplications for intertemporal consumer behavior in rewardprograms (hereinafter RPs) and other types of motivationalsystems (e.g., Deighton 2000; Hsee, Yu, and Zhang 2003;Kivetz 2003; Lal and Bell 2003).</p>
